                    I've made this website as an experiment to see if I could get people to find meaning in the
                    meaningless. At its core, the website is built around a made up psuedo-deep sentence that
                    combines "The Death of the Author" and "God is dead, and we have killed him" for no reason.
                    There is no purpose behind the quote except to get pseudointellectuals to think that it is deeper
                    than it is. To top it off, I changed the pronouns in the quote from "Him" to "Her," so they can
                    also add some gender analysis to their false interpretation.

                    To really add to the pseudo-deep aesthetic of the website, i made it black and white and used a
                    monospace font to make it look like I'm using the aesthetic as part of some message. I also split
                    the page in two for no reason other than because I felt it would look "deep."

                    This website is bullshit. On the front page, you're presented with a frankensteined combination of
                    two classic quotes that have nothing to do with each other. The rest of the website is littered
                    with surface-level analyses of this quote, none of which acknowledge the fact that the quote is
                    complete nonsense. In fact, the sheer amount of completely contradictory analyses shows that the
                    quote doesn't actually mean anything except for what one choses to read into it.

                    As if the contents of the website weren't enough, it is also presented in the most obnoxiously
                    pretentious way. With its minimalist black and white aesthetic, the website all but screams 
                    "LOOK AT HOW DEEP THIS IS."
