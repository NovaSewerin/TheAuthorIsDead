                    I made this website in an attempt to work through my feelings about my own eventual
                    death, as well as the life that comes before it. The "we have killed her." in the 
                    title shows that my life and my death do not exist in a vacuum.
                </p>

                <p class="theoryText">
                    The many different subpages on the website represent the many facets of life, eventually
                    ending on the final page: "nothing." This page represents the end of life - death.

                    The author writes about her own death in the website's title. This death is blamed on us,
                    the readers, or perhaps just society is a whole. This prompts us to ask the question: what
                    did we do to kill the author? What societal conditions have led to her death?
                </p>

                <p class="theoryText">
                    In addition to the title, the website also contains many subpages, each pertaining to a
                    rather large topic. This is again an allusion to the many facets of society that may have
                    led to the author's death.
