                    When making this website, I wanted to explore themes of subjectivity in art. 
                    My website's title is a direct reference to the essay "La mort de l'auteur" by Roland Bartes,
                    in which he argues against the author of a work as the sole authority on its meaning.
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    The website contains several different theories on its own meaning, which i did
                    to showcase the many different ways a work of art can be interpreted. I've separated each
                    page into two to show how the author and a reader might both come to hold a similar theory,
                    while relating to it in different ways.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="gridItem" ID="rightSide">
                <p class="theoryText">
                    The website's very name makes a reference to the Death of the Author, a literary
                    theory that positions the reader's subjective interpretation as being more important
                    than the intent of the author.
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    This theme is further reinforced by the website's layout, in which several
                    theories about its meaning are presented next to each other, all of which draw
                    completely different conclusions. Additionally, each page is separated in two, 
                    one side representing the author's intent and one side representing a possible reader's analysis.
