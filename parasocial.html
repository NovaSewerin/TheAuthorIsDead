                    When interacting with the internet, I often come across the idea of parasocial relationships.
                    A parasocial relationship is a one-sided relationship, typically between a creator and their fan,
                    in which one person doesn't even know the other, while the other knows a lot about them. I made
                    this website because I wanted to express how parasocial relationships unfold in the digital world.
                    I was particularly interested in how a person doesn't actually have a 
                    realistic view of the other part in a parasocial relationship, and thus they have "killed" 
                    them in favour of their own constructed ideal of them.
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    For this website, I wanted express this split between the "ideal" and the "real" person. I did
                    this by splitting the page in two, the left side being the author and the right side being
                    the reader.

                    A parasocial relationship is a relationship wherein one person interacts with another person
                    who is completely aware of their existence. In other words, it is the relationship typical
                    between artist and fan, between author and reader. The sentence "The author is dead and we
                    have killed her" is a commentary on these parasocial relationships, and how the the people
                    consuming the author's work end up "killing" the actual person that the author is in favour
                    of their constructed ideal of them.

                <p class="theoryText">
                    The layout of the website also reflects this dichotomy, as the website is split right down
                    the middle, with one side clearly representing the author and one side representing the reader.
