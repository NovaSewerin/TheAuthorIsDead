                    In recent years, generative AI has been evolving at a remarkably fast rate. I wanted to comment
                    on the implications this has on the role of the author. The title of the website is a way of saying
                    that we, as a society, have killed the author by embracing AI as a tool to create texts. We are
                    nearing a point where AI-generated texts are indistinguishable from texts written by real people.
                    For all you know, this very text could be written by an AI.
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    I wanted to illustrate the effects of the emergence of AI by filling the website with several pages
                    talking about the same simple prompt, the title of the website, but going in all sorts of
                    different directions.
                </p>

            <div class="gridItem" ID="rightSide">
                <p class="theoryText">
                    The first thing one is met with upon opening the website is the sentence "The author is dead and
                    we have killed her." This can be viewed as a metaphor for how our collective shift towards
                    embracing AI as a valid tool of authorship is slowly changing the role that traditional authors
                    play in our society. It is debateable whether AI will ever be able to completely mimic the
                    creativity that authors exhibit, but even the possibility of getting anywhere near that presents
                    a threat to human authors.

                <p class="theoryText">
                    The website contains several texts all discussing the same sentence and analysing it from different
                    points of view. While it is unclear whether these texts were man-made or AI-generated, the style
                    bears an eerie resemblance to that of an AI prompted to generate surface level analyses of a topic.
