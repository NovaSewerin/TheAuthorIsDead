                    I've long been fascinated by the way social media has slowly been replacing traditional media. In
                    traditional media, there is one, or a small group of, authors, who produce the work that
                    the reader then consumes. On social media, the author as a single figure has been replaced
                    with a collectively sourced authorship of the user experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    This collectively sourced work is represented on my website with the many subpages, each
                    containing a different part of the total experience. Thus, the work as a whole has no
                    single author, but rather several actors working as a superorganism to create it.
                </p>

                    The website greets the reader with the sentence "The author is dead, and we have killed her."
                    This sentence positions the author as a single figure and us, the collective, as those who have
                    killed her. In the context of social media, this can be viewed as a commentary of how traditional
                    media, with its more controlled authorship, is slowly being pushed to the side by social media,
                    which consists of a feed collectively created by all of us, rather than a single person.
                </p>

                <p class="theoryText">
                    The website's layout also reinforces this message, as it contains several subpages with conflicting
                    theories on the website's meaning. Thus, the overall message is not created by one person, but
                    rather by the collective.
