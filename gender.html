                    I wanted to use this website to explore different aspects of gender. Firstly, I was interested in
                    subverting the "male as norm" standard that is so prevalent in our society by changing the pronouns
                    of God (or rather, the Author, in my version of the quote) to "Her" instead of "Him." I also wanted
                    to play around with the idea of the feminine "author" being misrepresented by the masculine
                    "reader." Finally, I wanted to use the title of the website as a metaphor for the experience
                    of transgender people, who suffer at the hands of society. In this metaphor, the "author" represents
                    the trans person, who is trying to write their own story, while "we" represent society.
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    All of the different theories on the website can be related to major aspects of the experience of
                    gender exploration and transition. The layout, with one side of the page being the "author" and
                    the other being the "reader," is supposed to show how the trans person's interpretation of their
                    experience relates to the way it is interpreted by the people around them.

                <p class="theoryText">
                    The website's title is a play on the Nietzsche quote "God is dead, and we have killed him," only,
                    in this version, "Him" has been replaced by "Her." This represents how the modern world has killed
                    (or at least aspires to kill) the patriachal role of men. In the quote, God is replaced with the
                    author - a figure which is known for providing the texts that the readers then consume. This
                    relationship is not too dissimilar to the traditional provider role that men were supposed to play
                    in the household. It is no coincidence, then, that authorship has traditionally been a role mostly
                    occupied by men, with the exception of a few outliers.
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    The split layout of the page again illustrates this provider/consumer relationship, with the left
                    side being the author and the right side being the reader.
