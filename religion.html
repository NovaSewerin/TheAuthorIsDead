                    I wanted to make a website that explores the role religion plays in our
                    modern society. The title, "The Author is Dead and we Have Killed Her" is
                    a reference to the Friedrich Nietzsche quote "God is dead, and we have killed him."
                </p>
                <p class="theoryText">
                    The use of the word "author" instead of God, as well as the website's monospace font,
                    represents the advent of the printing press, as well as the enlightenment that came
                    with it. It is those societal changes that have led to the "death" of God.

            <div class="gridItem" ID="rightSide">
                <p class="theoryText">
                    The website's title is a modified version of "God is dead, and we have killed him" - a 
                    quote from Friedrich Nietzsche displaying the way people relate to God, and religion
                    as a whole, in our modern enlightened society.

                <p class="theoryText">
                    The many subpages with different theories represent the ways people try to find meaning
                    despite the death of God. It is fitting, then, that the last theory is that the website
                    is about nothing at all. God truly is dead.
